# Group 6 Team Collaboration debrief
What worked well in collaboration with your own team on this project? 

When we were able to get together, we were able to sort through each others problems, 
speeding up the coding and configuration process. Code reviews were also much easier 
when the group was able to meet together because team members could explain their 
thought process on the code. 

What should be improved next time to make your team better? 

We need to have our code finished earlier in order to prioritize reviews. 
We ran low on time and had to finish the actual code and review together on the last
day of the assignment being available. For next time, it might be a good idea to get 
baseline code done together, and then add details on our own to prevent confusion
and too much variablity in the features.
