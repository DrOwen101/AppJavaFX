I used AI for some of the more tedious parts of the code, like reformatting it to use style sheets to be swapped out for dark mode.
This was the most efficient way I could think to do it, and I think it paid off.
I definitely did need to refine the prompt to include pages, vboxes, and containiers, but eventually it worked itself out.
It also happened that every pass made more visual bugs to fix like buttons suddenly becoming transparent, so I went through and took care of those.
Other than that, most of it was hand-written. I think I did a good job there.
