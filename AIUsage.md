AI Overview:

For the addition we chose to make I ended up relying pretty heavily on copilot. We wanted to add the ability to search for current patients and streamline check in. I told copilot what I wanted to do and it did it, it worked pretty well but needed a few tweaks. I followed up by going in and breaking the monolith of a file down into neater and more modular files. I fixed some UI issues I had like adding a scroll pane to the new "existing patient check-in" window and I resized the search results pane as copilot left it about a cm tall. I also moved "existing patient" button from the main screen to the check in pop-up so that it appears as an option when the user clicks the check-in button along side new patient. Had AI create the commit message to adequately explain everything that was implemented.
