AI Reflection.

As I am still unable to fully comprehend JavaFX, unfortunately, I used AI to write pretty much all of the code. I will be spending the next few weeks as i see the assignments are less code heavy, giving me time to actually learn how to properly set up JavaFX and how to actually make GUIs.

I prompted the AI to make a dark mode that changes all backgrounds to the color #0d0d0d and all vboxes to the color #1a1a1a, while leaving all buttons and most text alone. Through many trial and error with the AI, I got it to look how I think is acceptable and meets the assignments criteria.

I understand JavaFX a little more but its still mostly a jumbled mess for me. I will figure it out eventually. But having to look at 1000s of lines of code throughout 10s of files I barely understand can explain why I haven't learned much... I'll get there.

But the AI has been helpful is explaining a little of what is going on.
