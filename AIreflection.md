I used AI to create the theme manager and to format the style sheets. 
Although AI gave me colors to use for light and dark theme, I decided that I would 
opt for just creating my own with a hex finder on google. 

AI was very helpful in formatting, creating and implementing the theme manager, but 
also seemed to fail miserably when it came to multi-file help
